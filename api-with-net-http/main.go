// A REST server has 3 main components

// Routes
// Route represent the State in REST
// As we know now, REST deals with the represantation of data
// in simplest term, route is anything after the host
// we match these routes in different ways to handle http actions

// Handlers
// Handlers as the name suggests, handles.
// In go terms Handler is an interface that has only one method: ServeHTTP
// It is any function that takes a ResponseWriter and pointer to a Request

// Server
// Server is the workhorse for our application
// this is what takes care of incoming request from our client
// It gets many names Mux, ServerMux, Server, Router etc.
